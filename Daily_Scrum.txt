Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? 
What are the impediments? 
What is your impediment removal plan?

Pui: Yes, I see an impediment. An impediment for me would be learning how the backend is associated to the

programming the frontend, so I will know what is happening from the user side.
