Our backlog was prioritized using several factors. Value-based Prioritization was used. 

We first created all User Storys and Tasks based on the requirements for Part 1. 

We then placed value in each User Story and Task. The value was based on the number of points we can get for the User Story and Task.

Second, we mapped out the risk for each User Story and Task. Items that we were less confident in, had a higher risk than simple documentation items. 

Third, we placed a dependency value to each User Story and Task. Tasks that need more time and resources (team members) where ranked at a higher dependency.

With each of these values placed on our backlog, we were able to assort accordingly. However, at the end of Part 1, some adjustments may be made for future sprint's backlogs. 

What we could improve for future Sprint's backlog is rational prioritization. This means that tasks that must be done before another task are appropriately prioritized in the backlog.
